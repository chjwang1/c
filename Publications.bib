abstract = {The tradeoff between damage self-sensing abilities and mechanical properties of composites is still a challenge for incorporating functional materials as potential sensing components. In this work, multifunctional carbon fabric coated with piezoelectric zinc oxide nanowires (ZnO NWs) was integrated into a carbon fiber reinforced composite as simultaneously a self-powered damage sensing component and mechanical reinforcement. The embedded ZnO NWs endowed the composite with in-situ self-sensing of damage. The sensing characteristics corresponding to the composite damage were validated by a well-established acoustic emission method. The results showed comparable performances to those obtained by common damage detection techniques. Additionally, the introduction of ZnO NWs had a positive impact on the mechanical properties of the host composite, increasing tensile and flexural strengths by 7.4% and 4.8%, respectively. These values were significantly higher than those of the interleaved strong piezoelectric PVDF thin films, leading to severe degradation in both tensile strength (−28.6%) and flexural strength (−82.4%). The enhanced mechanical properties may be ascribed to the interfacial mechanical interlocking and the increased bond area induced by the penetration of stiff ZnO NWs into the resin matrix. Overall, the excellent online and in-situ damage self-monitoring abilities with inherent structural benefits make ZnO NWs-based sensing scheme promising for broad applications in the field of structural health monitoring.},

abstract = {The interfacial shear strength between carbon fiber and polymer matrices plays a critical role in bulk mechanical performances of carbon fiber-reinforced polymer composites. However, finding simple and effective methods for modulating the interfacial adhesion remains challenging even after over a decade of research and development. Herein, a novel method based on electrically-assisted wetting technique was developed to strengthen the interfacial adhesion between carbon fiber and polymer matrix. The results indicated the polymer completely infiltrated the small grooves on the fiber surface under applied external electric field during the curing process, leading to the formation of conformal contact interface. The interfacial properties were characterized by utilizing the microdroplet debonding and single fiber fragmentation tests. It is found that the as-prepared composites exhibit a maximum increased interfacial shear strength (IFSS) reaching up to 119.69 MPa, a value 81.02% higher than that of the original fiber-based composites. The reinforcement mechanism was ascribed to the improved wettability and mechanical interlock effect induced by the applied electrical stimulus which was supported by dynamic simulation of two-phase flow. In sum, the suggested simple, facile, and environmentally friendly strategy can effectively regulate the interfacial load transfer capacity, thereby suitable for the optimal design of fiber-reinforced composites.},

abstract = {Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) additive manufacturing, as a novel technique provides broad benefits in thermoelectric materials synthesis, such as enhanced printing speed, reduced waste materials, and customized dimension design. The high energy density of laser could potentially balance the synthesis rate and thermoelectric figure-of-merit zT, but the correlations between laser energy and material performance are still vague. Herein, Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 bulks are directly synthesized by LPBF with a recorded synthesis rate of 254 g h−1. The maximum zT, without any post-processing, reaches 1.1 at 75 °C. Induced nanoscale pores by high laser energy printing, obtain a comparable diameter to phonon mean free path, leading to reduced lattice thermal conductivity and enhanced TE performance. We found that input laser energy critically affected thermoelectric performance and concluded the correlation between volumetric energy density EV and power factor PF, PF = 9.05EV2 – 30.01EV + 48.84. It potentially predicts thermoelectric performance with inputted laser energy density.},
