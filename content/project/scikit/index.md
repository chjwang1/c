<b>Master’s Corporative Project:<br> Enhanced mechanism research of electro-alignment in epoxy lamination</b><br>
This research was developed at Key Laboratory of the Ministry of Education & International Center for Dielectric Research in Xi'an Jiaotong University (XJTU) under my co-supervisors, <a href="https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/en/web/jzhang12"  target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prof. Jie Zhang</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0goGooAAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN"  target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prof. Jianying He</a>.<br>
Electrowetting is a technique that applies Maxwell force to induce positively and negatively charged nanoparticles to move in different directions to achieve micropore infiltration. The problem arises from the insufficient interface availability of this method at different scales. <b><i>What benefits can it bring to 2D/3D manufacturing and performance improvement</i></b>?<br>
In this project, we explored and demonstrated single fiber infiltration at a two-dimensional scale, which significantly improved the interface toughness and strength of the CNT reinforced epoxy composite lamination. At a 3D scale, it can be employed as a microscale hollow template filling method. This tech can significantly change and meditates on binding properties of hydrophobic interfaces.<br>

<b>Here are some key points that I achieved</b>:<br>
•  Analytical modal establishment and electric field simulation of Maxwell force driven Graphene alignment.<br>
•  Experiments of interface reinforcement and toughening of the heterogeneous adhesion surfaces.<br>
•  The related results was published at journal <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesb.2022.110368" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b><i>Compos. Part B Eng.</i></b> 234, 109751 (2022).</a>
