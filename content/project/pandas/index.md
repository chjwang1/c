<b>Master’s Independent Project:<br> Flexible piezoelectric multi-metamaterial and biometric multimodal electronics</b><br>
This research was developed at State Key Laboratory for Manufacturing Systems Engineering in Xi'an Jiaotong University (XJTU) under my 1st mentor, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=efLK4u4AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN"  target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prof. Xiaoming Chen</a>, and co-mentor, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tZeY-IcAAAAJ&hl=en"  target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prof. Jinyou Shao</a>. <br>
Biometric sensing electronics empower robotic hands with the ability to perform dexterous manipulation and object recognition, such as discerning softness, texture, and providing real-time feedback during grasping tasks, by emulating the mechanoreceptors found in human skin. These sophisticated systems are built upon three-dimensional (3D) microstructures, including wrinkles, protrusions, and villi, which facilitate electrical signal transmission. The integration of layered, embedded, and arrayed functional materials (FM) has become pivotal for achieving multimodal bio-integration. How can we obtain devices with the highest structural efficiency and programmable properties? <br>
Metamaterials emerging as an excellent choice. However, the heterogeneous design of devices and the combination of various response units are strictly indeed not generated more fabrication complexity. It is usually not achieved in an integrated mechanical manner, but rather by simply stacking and superimposing multiple layers. <i>We need to come up with a more straightforward general bio-design strategy to directly bridge physiological structures and bio-electronic expressions</i>. This remains a central challenge in the field. The crux that lies in the realization of sensing modes capable of detecting force, vibration, and torque within a single device, and the ability to easily decouple each response.<br>
Here are some key points that I achieved:<br>
•  Biometric design of serious piezoelectric lattices composed of skin-inspired axial and radial units.<br>
•  Higher-performed BNNS/CNT comfortable composites synthesis and characterization.<br>
•  Tailored gradient metamaterials properties optimization and achieved multimodal demonstration.<br>
•  Developed programmable devices with robust improvement in grasping and stiffness recognition. <br>
•  The related results was published at journal <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.device.2024.100658" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b><i>Device</i></b>. 3, 100658 (2025).</a>
