<b>Master’s Independent Project:<br> Flexible piezoelectric multi-metamaterial and biometric multimodal electronics</b><br>
This research was developed at State Key Laboratory for Manufacturing Systems Engineering in Xi'an Jiaotong University (XJTU) under my 1st mentor, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=efLK4u4AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN"  target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prof. Xiaoming Chen</a>, and co-mentor, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tZeY-IcAAAAJ&hl=en"  target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prof. Jinyou Shao</a>. <br>
Here are some key points that I achieved:<br>
•  Biometric design of serious piezoelectric lattices composed of skin-inspired axial and radial units.<br>
•  Higher-performed BNNS/CNT comfortable composites synthesis and characterization.<br>
•  Tailored gradient metamaterials properties optimization and achieved multimodal demonstration.<br>
•  Developed programmable devices with robust improvement in grasping and stiffness recognition. <br>
•  The related results was published at journal <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.device.2024.100658" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b><i>Device</i></b>. 3, 100658 (2025).</a>
