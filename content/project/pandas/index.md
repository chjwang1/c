<b>Master’s Independent Project:<br> Flexible piezoelectric multi-metamaterial and biometric multimodal electronics</b><br>
Here are some key points that I achieved:<br>
•  Biometric design of serious piezoelectric lattices composed of skin-inspired axial and radial units.<br>
•  Higher-performed BNNS/CNT comfortable composites synthesis and characterization.<br>
•  Tailored gradient metamaterials properties optimization and achieved multimodal demonstration.<br>
•  Developed programmable devices with robust improvement in grasping and stiffness recognition. <br>
