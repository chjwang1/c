<b>Master’s Corporative Project:<br> 
Hybrid printed Bi2Te3 thermoelectric piles for energy conversion</b><br>
This research was developed at Department of Physics in Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech) under co-supervisor, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1tlJQ-0AAAAJ&hl=en"  target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prof. Jianxu Shi</a>.<br>
In this project, we focused on the laser selected melting process of thermoelectric powders, which helps in the design and optimization of structured thermoelectric performance<br>.
<b>Here are some key points that I achieved</b>:<br>
•  Research of carrier-phonon decoupling theory; Thermoelectric composite synthesis. <br>
•  Conducted SLM of mixture powders; Properties simulation and Seebeck coefficient measurement. <br>
•  The related results was published at journal <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesb.2022.110368" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b><i>Ceram. Int.</i></b> 50, 2, 2921-2930 (2024).</a>
