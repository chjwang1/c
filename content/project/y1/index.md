<b>Bachelor’s Graduation Task: <br> Reliability optimization and validation of dump mechanical design</b> <br>
This research was developed at College of Civil Aviation of Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (NUAA) under my supervisor, <a href="https://scholar.google.com.ua/citations?hl=ru&user=ogtLwqMAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate"  target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prof. Tiniakov D</a>.<br>
Here are some key points that I achieved:<br>
•  Reliability validation of multilayered pump system based on Markov chain. <br>
•  Achieved dynamic simulation via Adams and Abaqus of virtual prototyping. <br>
•  The related results was reprented for the second award of <a href="https://chjwang1.github.io/c/award6.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b><i>National Ministry of Education of Graduation Dissertation Competition</i></b></a>. <br>
