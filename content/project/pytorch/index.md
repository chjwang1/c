<b>Master’s Independent Project:<br> Soluble polymetric UV resin cross-scaled forming and printing error restrain</b><br>
This research was developed at Department of Mechanical Engineering in The University of Hong Kong (HKU) under my co-mentor, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=rGTOkMkAAAAJ"  target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prof. Yang Lu</a>.<br>
Here are some key points that I achieved:<br>
•  Developed cross-scaled cured features and assessed multi-FMs demolding with no damage.<br>
•  Resolved resin dissolution at ambiance temperature, COMSOL simulation and theoretical analysis of droplet electrowetting infiltration and replacement in ultra-hydronic wax channels.<br>
•  The related results was published at journal <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.device.2024.100658" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b><i>Device</i></b>. 3, 100658 (2025).</a>
