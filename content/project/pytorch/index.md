<b>Master’s Independent Project:<br> Soluble polymetric UV resin cross-scaled forming and printing error restrain</b><br>
This research was developed at Department of Mechanical Engineering in The University of Hong Kong (HKU) under my co-mentor, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=rGTOkMkAAAAJ"  target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prof. Yang Lu</a>.<br>
Metamaterials, through the specific combination of structural units, provide a pathway for the multimodal integration and decoupling of bio-inspired electronic devices. There is a strong preference for pursuing design-manufacturing-performance integration of bio-inspired devices, which represents an enduring goal in the quest to explore a broader range of performance capabilities. However, the mismatch between manufacturing procedure and functional material severely limits the range of materials and processing methods available for bio-electronics development. <br>
As early as the Spring and Autumn period two thousand years ago, <i>lost-wax casting</i> technology was used to produce serval glorious bronzeware with complex structures and diverse compositions. Inspired by ancient wisdom, if the dissolvable wax molds could be prepared using micro-scale 3D printing, followed by the creation of hollow mold skeletons into which functional materials are injected, it would be possible to phototype randomly designed metamaterial electronics with tailored micro-columns and a wide variety of interested bio-material types.<br>
Here are some key points that I achieved:<br>
•  Developed cross-scaled cured features and assessed multi-FMs demolding method with no damage.<br>
•  Resolved resin dissolution at ambiance temperature, COMSOL simulation and theoretical analysis of droplet electrowetting infiltration and replacement in ultra-hydronic wax channels.<br>
•  The related results was published at journal <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.device.2024.100658" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b><i>Device</i></b>. 3, 100658 (2025).</a>
